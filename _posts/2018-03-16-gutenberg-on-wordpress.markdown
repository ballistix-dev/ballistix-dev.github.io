Heads Up! There will be an upcoming version update for Wordpress (Version 5) and the Content Editor (the WYSIWYG) will have a major change - and its called Gutenberg.

https://wordpress.org/gutenberg/

There's no final date on the upgrade yet but here's a read on things you need to know: https://ithemes.com/2017/11/09/gutenberg-wordpress-editor-10-things-to-know/

I had a sneak peek on this content editor and it looks like the one use on Wix.

So what's this have to do for us when the update comes?

1. We hold off upgrading to this version and do a test first. We are currently using a Page Builder plugin on most of our site and may not be compatible.
2. Learning curve, there will be a major change on how we create content layout and we may have to re-educate ourselves and also our clients who are editing content themselves - though IMHO it doesn't look that tough to learn.

change is good :D
